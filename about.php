                <strong>Our motto:</strong><span> Inspiring a clean, beautiful and healthy environment 
                </span>

                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <strong>The Clean Institute</strong> is a social enterprise established in 2018. 
                    It is an organization born out of a passion for promoting environmental well-being, cleanliness and good sanitation; and also, the desire to see beautiful surroundings, in terms of aesthetics, globally and primarily in Ghana, where it was started. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is fast becoming one of the nation's most respected non-governmental environmental cleanliness and sanitation organization due, in part, to its culture of innovation and excellence. 

                </p>

                    We operate with a mission to prevent poor sanitation and inspire and advance the restoration of unclean or dirty communities through organizational excellence and innovative strategies.

                    FACING THE TOUGHEST CHALLENGES 
                     </strong><br>
                    Climate change, as a result of filth and how we treat it, is the greatest threat faced by mankind today. This invariably leads to serious health challenges with its resultant effect on socio-economic development and wellbeing of people. It is a well-known fact that people naturally give a lot of importance to cleanliness and would prefer to live in places which are environmental friendly. Thus, together, we tackle challenges head on, on a daily basis, using our passion and expertise to inspire positive change.

                    SPEAKING OUT FOR POSITIVE CHANGE 
                     </strong><br>
                    When international bodies, governments, agencies and organizations make decisions or engage in activities that result in poor sanitation or destroy the aesthetics of our communities, we must speak out for change.
                    Campaigning works – it may take a lot of time and effort or be as simple as signing a petition but we know that speaking out and campaigning works! 
                    Campaign with us.

                    LOOKING TO THE BRIGHTER AND CLEANER FUTURE 
                     </strong><br>
                    We believe the future can be bright. We also believe that young people are the source of hope and engines for change when it comes to keeping our communities clean and beautiful. Therefore, we devote a lot of time and effort in schools across the country to educate students and inspire them to aspire for a clean, beautiful and healthy nation.

                    AWARDING AND ENDORSING THE CLEANEST
                     </strong><br>
                    In order to maintain a good standard of general cleanliness in communities, The Clean Institute has instituted an annual awards scheme, The Clean Awards®, to recognize and endorse the cleanest communities and some organizations. This we hope motivates people, District Assemblies, Municipalities, villages, towns, cities and organizations to strive and maintain general cleanliness in the hope of winning an Award.
